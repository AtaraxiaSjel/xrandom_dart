This library implements [Xorshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift) random number generators in native Dart.


Xorshift algorithms are known among the **fastest random number generators**, requiring very small code
and state.

The library has been thoroughly tested to match reference numbers generated by C algorithms. The
sources in C are taken directly from scientific articles by George Marsaglia and Sebastiano Vigna,
the inventors of the algorithms. The Xorshift128+ results are also matched to reference values from
JavaScript [xorshift](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/xorshift) library, that tested the 128+ similarly.

The library will work on all the platforms where `int` represents a 64-bit signed integer.
That is, on all platforms except Web/JavaScript.

Unit testing is done in the GitHub Actions cloud on Windows, Ubuntu and macOS.

# Usage

All classes implement the standard `Random` from `dart:math`, so they can be used in the same way. 

``` dart
import 'package:xorshift/xorshift.dart';

Random random = Xorshift();
print(random.nextInt(100));
print(random.nextDouble());

Random random32 = Xorshift32();
print(random32.nextInt(100));
print(random32.nextDouble());
```
