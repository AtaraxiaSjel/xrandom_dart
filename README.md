This library implements Xorshift random number generators in native Dart.

Xorshift algorithms are known as the **fastest random number generators**, requiring very small code
and state.

The library has been thoroughly tested to match reference numbers generated by C algorithms. The
sources in C are taken directly from scientific articles by George Marsaglia and Sebastiano Vigna,
the inventors of the algorithms. The Xorshift128+ results are also matched to reference values from
JavaScript [xorshift](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/xorshift) library, that tested the 128+ similarly. 

# Usage

All classes implement the standard `Random` from `dart:math`, so they can be used in the same way. 

``` dart
import 'package:xorshift/xorshift.dart';

Random random = Xorshift();
print(random.nextInt(100));
print(random.nextDouble());

Random random32 = Xorshift32();
print(random32.nextInt(100));
print(random32.nextDouble());
```
