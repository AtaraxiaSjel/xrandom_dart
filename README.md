This library implements Xorshift random number generators in native Dart.

Xorshift algorithms are known as the **fastest random number generators**, requiring very small code and state.

The library has been thoroughly tested to match reference numbers generated by C algorithms.
The sources in C are taken directly from scientific articles by George Marsaglia and Sebastiano Vigna,
the inventors of the algorithms.
